# Sockets
- A socket is defined as an **endpoint** for communication.
- A pair of processes communicating over a network use a pair of sockets, one for each process. 
- A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number.
- The server waits for incoming client requests by listening to a specified port. Once a request is received, the server accepts a connection from the client socket to complete the connection.

- Server implementing specific services(Such as telnet, FTP, and http). listen to well-known ports.

**Sockets are used for client-server based Systems**
